## Premise
PlantMe-NJ is an Android app dedicated to the aspect of gardening, specifically focusing on New Jersey crops and necessary gardening information, to promote a successful planting season every spring and summer.

The program plans to map the ideal planting spots of your plant beds, depending on the vegetables you have chosen, and it will have a feature that can display a potential plant in a selected spot using AR.

## Features
* Plant Information
    - Within the application, crop information will be readily available where a user can view:
        - List of plants best grown in NJ
        - Starting planting and harvesting dates
        - Description of each plant (i.e. spacing, depth, ideal environment)
* Recently Viewed
    - On the home page, you will be able to keep track of the last five crops that you have previously seen in older sessions.
* Plant Selection
    - Within the application, you will be able to select on two types: plant type or season. Based on your selection, crops from the selected plant type will appear for users to scroll through.
* Gallery
    - Within the application, a grid of plant photos will appear for users to tap on and view essential and pertinent information based on the selected plant.
* AR
    - Within the application, through the camera feature, you will be able to view a 3D-modeled version of a selected fully-grown crop. The idea is to combine the userâ€™s garden area with plant models, so the user is able to visualize the size and potential of their intended plant.
* Suggested Distance
    - Users will be able to take a snapshot of their garden bed or space, and based on their photo, they will be able to drag and form their intended space.
    - After creating their planting area, suggested planting spots will appear to notify the users of what is the appropriate recommended spacing prior to gardening.
