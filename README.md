## Premise
For my thesis project, my initial plan was to develop a mobile application using my programming skills and design abilities. The main goal is to create the application using Android Studio, but if that is not entirely feasible, then Unity or Flutterflow would serve as a possible alternative. Once created, the app can only be used on Android devices, and to form the design features, I am planning on using Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator for the visual aspect.

In terms of usage, the app would be focused on gardening, specifically selecting which plants would be ideal to plant in New Jersey, mapping out where to plant the crops, and visually displaying the potential plant in a certain spot using AR. It would require the usage of a deviceâ€™s camera and possibly a location feature.

## Sprint Goals
For my startup sprint, using my thesis idea, I plan to:
- Design a super basic mobile app that will load on my phone using Android Studio
- Research on possible vegetable/flower plants that can grow in New Jersey
- Begin to gather possible reference images based on the plants selected

## Mock App Features
Within the sprint mobile application, it will have the following features:
- List of plants and starting planting/transplanting dates
- Description of each plant
- Images of plants
- Home page of the name of the application

## Sample Photos
- Home Page
- Plant Page
- Season Page
